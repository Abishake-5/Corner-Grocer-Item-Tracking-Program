# **Corner Grocer Item Tracking Program**

## **Overview**
The **Corner Grocer Item Tracking Program** is a C++ console application created to help a grocery store analyze its daily sales data. The program reads a file containing a list of items purchased throughout the day and counts how often each item appears. By understanding which items are most frequently bought, the store can optimize its layout and improve customer experience.  

This project was completed as part of the **Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (CS-210)** and demonstrates the use of programming fundamentals, file handling, data structures, and clean coding practices.

## **Features**
- **Item Lookup:** Search for a specific item and display how many times it was purchased.  
- **Full Item Frequency List:** View all items and how often each one appears in the dataset.  
- **Histogram Visualization:** Display each item followed by asterisks (*) representing purchase frequency.  
- **Data Backup:** Automatically generates a backup file containing all items and their purchase counts.  
- **Exit Option:** Cleanly terminates the program when the user is done.

## **Reflection**

### **Project Summary**
This project focuses on solving a real-world problem where a grocery store wants to understand its sales data. The program analyzes text data, counts item frequencies, and presents the results in user-friendly formats to guide business decisions.

### **What I Did Well**
I organized the logic using clear functions and efficient data structures. The user menu was simple and intuitive, and the program successfully handled file input and output with accurate frequency counts.

### **Areas for Improvement**
In future versions, I would enhance input validation and handle errors more effectively. I would also refactor parts of the code into additional classes to make it more modular and reusable for larger datasets.

### **Challenges and How I Overcame Them**
Working with file input and C++ maps was initially challenging. I overcame these issues through testing, debugging, and researching examples from documentation. Debugging step-by-step helped ensure accuracy in the output.

### **Transferable Skills**
This project strengthened my understanding of structured programming, file operations, and data analysis. The skills I gained here—especially in logic building, problem-solving, and code organization—will transfer directly to future programming projects.

### **Maintainability and Readability**
To keep the program maintainable, I used consistent formatting, clear variable names, and inline comments to explain each step. The design separates the counting logic from the display functions, making the program easy to expand and maintain.

## **Purpose in Portfolio**
This project demonstrates my ability to design, document, and implement a functional **C++ application** that follows **industry best practices**. It highlights my capability to create **efficient, readable, and maintainable code** while solving a practical problem using software development skills.
